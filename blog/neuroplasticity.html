    <h2>Neuroplasticity.</h2>

      First off, Neuroplasticity (also known as brain plasticity) is the brain's ability 
      to change and adapt as a result of experience.<br>
      <br>
      
      There are <b><a href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/">10 Principles of Neuroplasticity.</a></b>  
      This  article gives an outline of each principle and i found it quite useful 
      for helping me understand each of them. In particular I found 
      "Use it or lose it", "Use it and improve it" and "Intensity Matters" to resonate with me 
      the most. These simple principles have helped me grow as an individual and aided in 
      keeping my mindset as a growth type. 
      
      <h5>Use it or lose it.</h5>
      Basically, when you dont do something for a long time, your brain degrades that
      function to save brain power. Normally called getting rusty, people might need to
      brush off the rust by starting to do the thing they got rusty at.

      <h5>Use it and improve it.</h5>
      The previous Principle i described also leads into this one. This principle is exactly
      what it sounds like. The more you do something, the better you get at it. Repetition 
      and consistency is the key to this principle.
      
      
      <h5>Intensity Matters.</h5>
      This one made me look at myself properly and understand what works for me. I looked at
      how intense I need to dive into new subjects, how long I can stay focused for and how
      often do i need a break to reset my focus to ensure efficiency and optimal learning. 
      This principle was one of the most satisfying things to understand.
   
    <h2>Growth Mindset.</h2>
      This is a biggie. I feel like my research into this topic has helped me immensely.
      First off, what is it? Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that allows you to 
      improve and overcome challenges. It is a belief that you can develop your intelligence
      and talents, a belief you are not stuck and can change, you are not incompetent because
      you cannot solve a problem, you just dont have the answer yet.

    <h2>Yet.</h2>
      A small yet powerful word. I first come into contact with the power of this word 
      while watching a TED Talk with Dr. Carol Dweck:<br>
      <br>


      
      <div style="max-width:854px">
        <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%">
          <iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen>
          </iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
        While watching I initially thought this lady was boring. After about a minute of 
        actually listening to what she was saying I was hooked. And once she described the
        power concept of the word yet, I became a Dr. Dweck supporter. This sudden realisation
        helped me with my self doubt I had been having over the last few weeks. My mindset has been
        changing slowly over this last week to be more confident and that I am on the right path.
        Although looking back I can say that my mindset is not perfect as I still have tendencies 
        to stray from this Growth Mindset. Well It's not perfect Yet.
