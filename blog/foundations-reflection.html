  <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      Hmm what have I learnt about myself... well first off I would like to say that I have grown as a person through these foundations and I've grown an appreciation of coding and how difficult it can be.
      Now what I have learnt about myself and my ego. My ego grows as I solve things easily, it also takes heavy hits when I make mistakes. I have learnt that I need to have more patience with myself
      when I am learning new things. I also noticed that I don't ask for help as often as I should, this could be because most of the men I have grown up with have been stoic and independant father figures and 
      I may be psychologically mimicing them. Maybe.
      
    </p>


  <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
    <p>
      Well basically these three things contribute towards keeping your mindset growth focused and not being a pain to work with.

    </p>

  <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      It's not all rubbish mystical magical voodoo nonsense that I thought it would be at the start of Foundations.

    </p>

  <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      Talking about myself honestly... to myself. I had never done this before, or never seriously thought about it so it wasn't the easiest thing to do.

    </p>

  <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>
      Because these skills are highly valued in the workplace and ultimately will contribute to us finding employment once the course is over.
      Also no one likes working with ignorant dicks

    </p> 

  <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      Nah personally I think studying core has taught me alot about myself. At first I thought this would be something to laugh about at the end and I had even made jokes to my friends about it. But that all changed
      once i actually experienced and researched the effects. I feel like the meditation routine was the first turning point, but the study on growth mindset made me a believer.
