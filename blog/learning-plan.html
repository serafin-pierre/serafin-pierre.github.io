        What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br><br>

-Long term goal is to become a developer for a major publisher for video games or a FANG company.<br><br>


A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning<br><br>

-Strengths would include a curious mind and a striving force to succeed in anything I do.
-Weaknesses would include distractions leading to procrastination.<br><br>

What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br><br>

-I would like to learn how to network and build rapport with people quickly<br><br>


A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives:<br><br>

-Focus on one task at a time while taking regular breaks. Actively listening when interacting with others and respecting their boundaries.<br><br>

What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:<br><br>

-Lean on friends and family for support and reach out for help sooner rather than later<br><br>

A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:<br><br>

-Communication as early as possible with relevant information<br><br>

A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team<br><br>

-Guidance and support while working towards the goal of finishing foundations & bootcamp<br><br>

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. 
It's important to plan these in.<br><br>

-Personally I have no other commitments and will be going full steam ahead on this programme

<h1>Learning Plan 2. The Sequel. El Numero Dos</h1>


<div>
  <h5>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h5>
    <p>
      I am hoping to use the skills I get from this course to get my foot in the door in the development space, eventually
      jumping into game and app development.

    </p>

  <h5>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h5>
    <p>
      Re evaluating what I wrote in sprint 2, I think i have the same limitations being distractions
      but I have also grown through my core studies and have learnt that I need to manage my 
      distractions and also can flip them into a positive by using them to take a breather
      and come back with fresh eyes.

      I think the intensity of bootcamp will not allow time for distraction and I have been working
      on managing distractions.
    </p>

  <h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
    <p>
      I think personally I would benefit from more communication coaching, sometimes I talk too much,
      other times not enough. Also getting better at reflection I think would help me just
      as a human being.

    </p>

  <h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h5>
    <p>
      I think the biggest challenge will be getting settled and getting to know the strangers
      that I will be going through this experience with. This could also be a fun and exciting
      opportunity to meet new people. But I tend to be quiet around new people until I feel 
      comfortable.
    </p>

  <h5>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h5>
    <p>
      Guidance and maybe help when it is needed.
    </p>

  <h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h5>
    <p>
      To push myself both mentally and socially. I will ask for help when I need it and not struggle
      quietly in a corner. I make a commitment here that I will do my best to work super productively by focusing
      and to be mindful of others.
    </p>
