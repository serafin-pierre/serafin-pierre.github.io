Well to answer that question lets say you have a few photos that you are hanging on a wall.
<br>
Each photo is covered by a material that puts space between the photo and the frame.
<br> 
That space would be the padding.
<br>
<br>
The frame that surrounds the photo. 
That would be the border.
<br>
<br>
Each picture has a set space around the outside. 
This would be our margin. 
<br>
<br>
If two pictures are handing side by side with about 10cm between them, 
then we might say that they each have a 5cm margin. 
<br>
<br>
Below is an image that depicts the Box Model.

The CSS Box Model is used to create a definition for the way 
the HTML elements (or our "photos") are arranged on the screen.
