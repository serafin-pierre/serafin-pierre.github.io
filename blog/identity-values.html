        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        
        While working hospitality there are some questionable things that are, at times, asked of you.
        One of these times was during my second year as a junior chef in a buffet style kitchen.
        My boss at the time asked all of us to save the leftover meat from customers plates to use in a dish the next day.
        The thought of this made me sick as it is not only unsanitary, but also against what you learn during health and safety training.
        Needless to say I reported this to our General Manager after disposing of what he asked us to keep.
        
        Reflecting on this decision I think i made the best choice available at the time but i was left frustrated after
        he convinced everyone it was a misunderstanding.
        
        
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
        
        Growing up in a pacific island house hold has influenced me greatly. My late grandfather taught me what hard work is.
        My late grandmother showed me what a loving family was and my mother always wanted what was best for me.
        
        
        
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
        
        -Self driven, I can motivate myself to push forward.
        -Independant, I like working on my own.
        -Curious, I dive into things I know nothing about till my curiosity is satisfied.
        -Grinder, when I commit to something I wont stop till I achieve my goal.
        
        
        
        
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        
        -I struggle to open up to new people.
        -Asking for help isn't something im used to, gotta get better at this!
        -Autopilot, when I get comfortable I tend to go on autopilot and that can lead to mistakes.
        
        
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
        Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
        
        While working in hospitality the tensions during the busy times reaches peak. 
        One particular time I got in an argument with a co worker about him asking one of the team members to clean while we still needed him for service.
        At the time it was very important we had all hands on and I was trying to explain to him why but he just ignored me and we fell behind in our work.
        I think raising my voice caused him to shut down and reject my words no matter what they were. I probably would be more calm about the approach
        and try to make them understand my point of view instead of getting heated because of the situation we were in.
